    <p>Ok, So below I have a couple of links to my other pages here. Mainly
    they are just SPAs so that I can practice a bit of everyting. At some
  point I hope to make this website look a bit nicer and have some dynamic
features too! For now, I'm doing what I can.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><a href='SPAs/spa1/spa1.html'>SPA1</a> A Simple JS Timer (Single Page Application)</li>
  </ul>
